   "Description": "The CardDAV image export functionality as implemented in Nextcloud allows the download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.<strong>Note:</strong> Nextcloud employs a very strict Content Security Policy on the DAV endpoints. This is thus only exploitable on browsers that don't support Content Security Policy.",
   "ActionTaken": "The mimetype of the exported image is now compared with a whitelist as well as download disposition headers have been set on the response.",
